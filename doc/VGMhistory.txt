    (with embedded CLHEP 2.4.1.3)
    Mac OSX 10.14.6: with Apple LLVM version 11.0.0

  26/02/2020
  version 4.7
    New features:
      CMake upgrade:
      - Updated cmake minimim version to 3.8
      - Make VGM relocatable:
      - Use Geant4 compilation flags (including cxx standard) if built with Geant4,
        ROOT compilation flags if built with Root and without Geant4
        set c++11 standard explicitly if Geant4 and Root use files are not used
        (at it is the default for CLHEP build)

    Fixes:
      - Fixed the examples top CMake file for building all examples outside
        VGM build

    Tested with Root 6.18/04, Geant4 10.05.p01
    (with embedded CLHEP 2.4.1.0)
    Mac OSX 10.14.6: with Apple LLVM version 11.0.0

  06/01/2020
  version 4.6
    New features:
    - Applied clang-format:
      Processed all .h and .cxx files in packages and test (except files for Doxygen)
    - Added a possibility to change the dimensions of a dummy box replacing…
      the unsupported shapes if the 'ignore' option is activated by the user:
      - via a second argument of IFactory::SetIgnore(..)
      - via a new function IFactory::SetDummyBoxDimensions(double value)

    Fixes:
    - Allow compiling with non Apple Clang on macOS 
      (Thanks to Giulio Eulisse, CERN)
    - Improve finding of CLHEP libraries.
      (Thanks to Oliver Freyermuth, , University of Bonn)
    - Fixed dimensions of polyhedra in the tests.

    Tested with Root 6.18/04, Geant4 10.05.p01
    (with embedded CLHEP 2.4.1.0)
    Mac OSX 10.14.6: with Apple LLVM version 11.0.0

  25/01/2019
  version 4.5
    New features:
    - Added support for G4ReplicatedSlice (which defines division with gaps):
      As there is not an equivalent placement in Root, this feature is emulated
      by default via an intermediate division without gaps and a placement of the
      cell volumes. This however results in a different volume hieararchy than in the source
      (Geant4 geometry)
      When a new, "bestMatch" option is selected, this feature is implemented
      via simple placements of the cells in the mother volume, what may be ineffiecient
      in case of a large number of divisions.
      - Only box shapes are supprted in this first version
    - Added "bestMatch" option to VGM::IFactory, used only in the context of
      division with a gap in Root geometry
    - Added new "Placements2" test with divisions with gaps and "ignore" and "bestMatch"
      run options in vgm_test

    Fixes:
    - CMake build: Add support for ROOT compiled with C++14:
      (thanks to Dario Berzano, CERN)

    Tested with Root 5.34/38 and 6.14/06, Geant4 10.05
    (with embedded CLHEP 2.4.1.0)
    Mac OSX 10.14: with Apple LLVM version 10.0.0

  06/02/2017
  version 4.4
    New features:
    - Implemented mode for a single solid conversion, which can be used 
      in the following way:
        XFactory xFactory;
        YFactory yFactory;
        xFactory.Import(xsolid);
        xFactory.Export(yFactory);
        YSolid* ysolid = yFactory.Solid();
      See also the new singleMode option in TstDetectorConstruction class 
      in vgm_test.
    - Added support for ScaledSolid (available in Geant4 10.3)
  
    Fixes: 
    - Fixed gcc 5.4 compliation issue 
      (Thanks to Oliver Freyermuth, University of Bonn)
    - Define the default CMake build mode if not set by the user

        the shape is imported in VGM as a displaced big box solid.
      - In Placement:
