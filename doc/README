 1. Introduction
 ---------------

 The Virtual Geometry Model (VGM) has been developed as generalization
 of existing convertors roottog4, g4toxml provided within 
 <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/vmc/VirtualMC.html"> Geant4 VMC </a> 
 when new directions: g4toroot, roottoxml were asked by users.
 Instead of adding other bilateral converters and multiplying
 the implementations, the abstract layer to geometry has been defined
 and the geometry models have been "mapped" to this generalized
 models. Once this is done, the geometry objects in different models 
 can be handled in the same way.
 
 In the VGM, the abstract interfaces to geometry objects and an abstract 
 factory for geometry construction, import and export are introduced.
 The interfaces to geometry objects were defined to be
 suitable to describe "geant-like" geometries with a hierarchical volume
 structure.
 
 The implementation of the VGM for a concrete geometry model represents
 a layer between the VGM and the particular native geometry.
 At the present time this implementation is provided for the Geant4 and
 the Root TGeo geometry models.

 Using the VGM factory, geometry can first be defined independently from
 a concrete geometry model, and then built by choosing a concrete
 instantiation of it. Alternatively, the import function of the VGM factory
 makes it possible to use VGM directly with native geometries (Geant4,
 TGeo). The export functions provide conversion into other native 
 geometries or the XML format.

 To port a third geometry model, then providing the VGM layer for it is 
 sufficient to obtain all the converters between this third geometry and 
 already ported geometries (Geant4, Root).

 2. Installation, Examples
 -------------------------
 
 The installation and testing procedures are described in detail
 in vgm/doc/INSTALL and in vgm/doc/INSTALL_CMT for CMT users.
 As the test program (being written for the purpose of testing of all
 features) is too complex, four simple examples demonstrating use
 of VGM for converting native geometries are provided in vgm/examples.
 A detailed guide how to build and run the examples is included
 in the README file in each example.
 

 3. Geometry conversions
 -----------------------
 
 To convert native geometry from one geometry model to another,
 the geometry has to be first imported in the VGM (the native geometry 
 objects are mapped to the VGM interfaces) using the concrete VGM factory 
 for this geometry model, and then exported using the VGM factory for 
 the other geometry model.
 
 To convert Geant4 geometry in Root:

 #include "Geant4GM/volumes/Factory.h" 
 #include "RootGM/volumes/Factory.h" 
 #include "TGeoManager.h"
 
  // Import Geant4 geometry to VGM
  //
  Geant4GM::Factory g4Factory;
  g4Factory.Import(physiWorld);
     // where physiWorld is of G4VPhysicalVolume* type
  
  // Export VGM geometry to Root
  //
  RootGM::Factory rtFactory;
  g4Factory.Export(&rtFactory);
  gGeoManager->CloseGeometry();
  
  // Return top volume
  //
  return rtFactory.World();
      // returns Root top volume, of TGeoVolume* type
      
  The geometry conversions between Geant4 and Root
  geometry models are demonstrated in examples E01 and E02.


 4. Geometry construction via VGM
 --------------------------------
 
 The VGM interfaces can be used to define geometry independently
 from a concrete geometry model:

 #include "VGM/volumes/IFactory.h"
 #include "ClhepVGM/transform.h"

 using namespace VGM;

 MyDetectorConstruction::Construct(VGM::IFactory* factory)
 {
   double wSize = 10*m;
   GISolid* worldS
     = factory->CreateBox("worldS", wSize, wSize, wSize);
                // create the world solid

   GIVolume* worldV
     = factory->CreateVolume("worldV", worldS, "Air");
                // create the world volume 

   factory->CreatePlacement("world", 0, worldV, ClhepVGM::Identity());
                // place the world volume 
 }    
 
 Choosing the concrete factory (Geant4 or Root VGM factory)
 will then build the geometry of the chosen model ( Geant4 or Root):

 #include "Geant4GM/volumes/Factory.h"
 MyDetectorConstruction myDetectorConstruction;
 Geant4GM::Factory theFactory;
 myDetectorConstruction->Construct(&theFactory);
         // Geant4 geometry will be built
 
 #include "RootGM/volumes/Factory.h"
 MyDetectorConstruction myDetectorConstruction;
 RootGM::Factory theFactory;
 myDetectorConstruction->Construct(&theFactory);
         // Root geometry will be built
 
 5. XML
 -------
 
 The VGM geometry can be exported to XML in the AGDD or GDML format.
 The complying with the XML schema is embedded in the VGM XML exporter
 code itself, no external XML parser is then needed.

 #include "XmlVGM/AGDDExporter.h"
 XmlVGM::AGDDExporter xmlExporter1(&theFactory);
 xmlExporter1.GenerateXMLGeometry();
      // Export geometry to AGDD

 #include "XmlVGM/GDMLExporter.h"
 XmlVGM::GDMLExporter xmlExporter2(&theFactory);
 xmlExporter2.GenerateXMLGeometry();
      // Export geometry to GDML
  
 The export from native geometries (Geant4, Root) to XML
 is demonstrated in examples E03 and E04.
 The exported XML files (both AGDD, GDML) can be then viewed
 with the GraXML tool.
