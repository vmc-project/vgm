 The Virtual Geometry Model - Installation with CMT
====================================================
 
 Interfaces:
 -----------
  CMT is a powerfull configuration management tool. See http://www.cmtsite.org/ 
  for more ionformations

  CMT requires some interfaces files to configure Interface between VGM and others 
  packages. These packages are: Geant4, CLHEP and ROOT.
  
  If you don't have these CMT Interfaces files, you can dawnload them 
  from LAL CVS serever, using the following command for each package:
  > cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvsserver.lal.in2p3.fr:/projects/cvs checkout Interfaces/PACKAGE Interfaces/PACKAGE/vxxx
              where PACKAGE = ROOT, Geant4, CLHEP, Platform.  
  Note that besides the packages mentioned above you need also
  platform dependent configuration files provided within package Platform.	      

  To let CMT know about the location of these files
  you have to set the environment variable CMTPATH.

  You now have to specify where are your ROOT, Geant4 and CLHEP directories :
    - open the Interface/ROOT/v****/cmt/requirements file and edit the 
      ROOT_home macro to match your installation
    - open the Interface/Geant4/v****/cmt/requirements file and edit the 
      Geant4_home macro to match your installation
    - open the Interface/CLHEP/v****/cmt/requirements file and edit the 
      CLHEP_home macro to match your installation

 Compilation:
 -----------
   cd vgm/cmt
   source $where_cmt_is_install/mgr/setup.csh   
   export CMTPATH="where_you_have_put_your_CLHEP_ROOT_GEANT4_InterfacesFiles"
   cmt config
   . setup.sh
   cmt make VGM

 Test:
 -----
   cd vgm/cmt
   cmt make tests
   
   For different test options, see vgm/test/README file;
   eg.
   vgm_test.exe VGM Geant4 Root noXML Solids

   For launching "test suite" files :
   ../test/test1_suite.sh  or
   ../test/test2_suite.sh
   The output from tests stored in log directory can be then compared
   with the reference output in vgm/test/log_ref directory.
 
 Examples:
 ---------
   cd vgm/cmt
   cmt make examples
 
 Tested platform:
 -----------------
   Linux FC5, gcc 4.1.1
   MacOS Powerbook 10.4.8 gcc 4.0.1
