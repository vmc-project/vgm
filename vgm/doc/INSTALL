 The Virtual Geometry Model - Installation
=================================================
 
 Environment:
 -----------
   The following environment variables have to be set by user:
   VGM_INSTALL     - path to the VGM installation
   VGM_SYSTEM      - platform (Linux-g++, Darwin, SunOS, DEC-cxx, HP-aCC)
   CLHEP_BASE_DIR  - path to the CLHEP installation
                     (if not provided with Geant4 installation)
   G4VMC           - path to Geant4 VMC installation 
                     (optional, needed only for test)                  

   In order to build VGM with Geant4 and/or Root,
   the environment for these packages has to be set in their 
   standard way.

   User can exclude Geant4 or Root from compilation by setting variables:
   VGM_NO_GEANT4 - do not build Geant4GM
   VGM_NO_ROOT   - do not build RootGM

   Note that the VGM complete test requires G4Root provided
   in Geant4 VMC; building with G4Root can be excluded
   by setting variable:
   VGM_NO_G4ROOT   - do not build VGM test with G4Root

   Geant4 configuration:
   The VGM requires Geant4 installed with include directory.

   The path to VGM libraries $VGM_INSTALL/lib/$VGM_SYSTEM
   has to be added to the path to shared libraries
   (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on most systems, SHLIB_PATH on HP-UX).
   
   The default environment setting (for VGM only) is provided 
   in the config/setup.(c)sh script.   
  
 Compilation:
 -----------
   cd $VGM_INSTALL/packages
   make  

 Test:
 -----
   To build test program:
   cd $VGM_INSTALL/test
   . env_setup.sh   or  source env_setup.csh
   make
   
   For different test options, see vgm/test/README file;
   eg.
   vgm_test VGM Geant4 Root noXML Solids

   For launching test suites:
   ./test1_suite.sh  or
   ./test2_suite.sh
   ./test3_suite.sh
   The output from tests stored in log directory can be then compared
   with the reference output in log_ref directory.


 Examples:
 ---------
   To build examples:
   cd $VGM_INSTALL/examples
   ./install.sh
   
   How to run each example see in their README file.
