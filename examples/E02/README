 VGM Example E02
 Converting geometry from Root to Geant4
 ----------------------------------------
 
 Source: Geant4 basic B4a example
         With modified detector construction
 
 See Geant4 documentation in README_Geant4 and
 https://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/Doxygen/examples_doc/html/ExampleB4.html
         
 1. Build example:
    The example is built in the same way as a standard Geant4 example;
    the VGM packages are already provided in CMakeList.txt
    The example program is called exampleE02.
     
 2. Run example, the geometry will be imported from Root file during 
    initialization:
    $ exampleE02
